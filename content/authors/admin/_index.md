I'm a linguist who studies the variability inherent in language. In my research, I analyze statistical patterns in large bodies of speech data in order to better understand how and why people talk differently---in different places, in different situations, and over time. I'm particularly interested in theoretical and empirical perspectives on intra-speaker variation.

I am a co-director of the [NYU Sociolinguistics Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/sociolab/), a co-PI on the NSF-funded [NYC Individual Differences Corpus project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2234098&HistoricalAwards=false), and one of the academic leads of [Our Dialects](https://www.ourdialects.uk/), an online atlas of British English regional dialects. I have published academic articles and book chapters on sociolinguistics, language variation, language change, dialectology, and linguistics pedagogy; I have also served as an expert consultant for media pieces on regional dialects, language change, personal names, and how speakersâ€™ accents can change over time.

Outside of work, I can often be found [birding in Washington Square Park](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L1628412).
