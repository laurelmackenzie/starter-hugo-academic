abstract: 'This paper investigates analogical leveling in a small set of English nouns that have
irregular plural forms. In these nouns, all of which end in a voiceless fricative, the
fricative standardly voices in the plural (e.g., *wolf–wol[v]es*, *path–pa[ð]s*, *house–
hou[z]es*). Using audio data from three large spoken corpora of American English,
I demonstrate that this stem-final fricative voicing is variable and conditioned by a
number of factors, most notably the identity of the stem-final fricative—with /f/-
final lexemes (e.g., *wolf*), /θ/-final lexemes (e.g., *path*), and the /s/-final lexeme
*house* all patterning differently in apparent time—and the frequency of a lexeme in
its plural form. I argue that the way these two factors affect the variation is
reminiscent of the patterns seen in children’s first language acquisition errors,
providing a potential source for the variation and underscoring the importance of
considering morphophonological factors when accounting for patterns of change.'
