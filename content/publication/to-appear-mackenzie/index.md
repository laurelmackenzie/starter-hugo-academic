abstract: 'Few lifespan studies capture their speaker using more than one style, despite the
potential benefits of doing so. Multi-style longitudinal data can help disentangle lifespan change
from style-shifting; it can shed light on how older speakers use socially meaningful variants; and
it can tell us about whether and how a speaker’s stylistic range can change over the lifespan. In
this chapter, I address these points through a longitudinal study of /ɹ/-tapping in a 60-year corpus
of David Attenborough’s televised nature documentaries. Focusing on /ɹ/-tapping in word-internal
position (e.g., very, squirrel, forest), I use generalized additive mixed models to track
Attenborough’s /ɹ/-tapping in two styles: pre-recorded narration and (semi-)extemporaneous
onscreen speech. I find that Attenborough remains a stylistically dynamic speaker across his
lifespan, though he taps less in narration style after the first two decades of his career have
passed, causing his stylistic range to diminish. I discuss possible explanations for this finding,
including changes in television broadcasting norms since the 1950s; sensitivity on
Attenborough’s part to community change away from /ɹ/-tapping; and the reduced social pressure
to use high-formality variants in later life, particularly after having achieved great success in
one’s career.'
