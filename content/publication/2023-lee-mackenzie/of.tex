\section{Introduction -- LM}

A longstanding question in sociolinguistics is whether social evaluation of a variant is consistent across linguistic environments. It is traditionally assumed that external factors (such as social evaluation) and internal factors (such as linguistic environment) do not interact in the conditioning of variation (Labov 1993, 2001:28, 2010:265), but this has largely gone untested (Maddeaux \& Dinkin 2017).

In this paper, we report on a study of a single variable alternation in English -- between of and Ã˜ -- that is instantiated in several distinct linguistic environments. We find that its social patterning differs by environment, suggesting a counterexample to the proposed independence of external and internal constraints.
