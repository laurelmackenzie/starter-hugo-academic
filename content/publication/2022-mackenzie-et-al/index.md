abstract: 'This paper presents the results of a survey of phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic
 variation in British English, based on over 14,000 responses. We map twelve variables using
 geospatial ‘hotspot’ analysis. One of our aims is to document the patterning of under- and
 unstudied variables. A second aim is to track changes in real time, which we do by
 comparing our findings to those of the 1950s-era Survey of English Dialects (SED, Orton
 1962). We improve upon previous dialectological work by paying careful attention to the
 phonemic status of mergers and splits: in our contemporary data, we do this by asking
 subjects if they have a phonemic contrast; in the SED data, we do this by superimposing the
 isoglosses for individual phones. We find evidence for both stability and change; we
 document previously unverified patterns. Perhaps most importantly, we identify a number
 of directions for future research.'
