abstract: "Few lifespan studies capture their speaker using more than one style, despite the potential benefits of doing so. Multi-style longitudinal data can help disentangle lifespan change from style-shifting, it can shed light on how older speakers use socially meaningful variants, and it can tell us about whether and how a speaker's stylistic range can change over the lifespan. In this chapter, I address these points through a longitudinal study of /ɹ/-tapping in a 60-year corpus of David Attenborough's televised nature documentaries. Focusing on /ɹ/-tapping in word-internal position (e.g., *very, squirrel, forest*), I use generalized additive mixed models to track Attenborough's /ɹ/-tapping in two styles: pre-recorded narration and (semi-) extemporaneous on-screen speech. I find that Attenborough remains a stylistically dynamic speaker across his lifespan, though he taps less in narration style after the first two decades of his career have passed, causing his stylistic range to diminish. I discuss possible explanations for this finding, including changes in television broadcasting norms since the 1950s, sensitivity on Attenborough's part to community change away from /ɹ/-tapping, and the reduced social pressure to use high-formality variants in later life, particularly after having achieved great success in one's career."
