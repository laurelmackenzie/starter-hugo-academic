abstract: 'This paper has three goals: (1) to document the factors shaping *is*-contraction in Mainstream American English; (2) to assess the extent to which these factors also shape contraction of *has*; (3) to use shared patterns of contraction across the two verbs to draw conclusions about how the varying forms are represented grammatically. While *is* has two distinct phonological forms in variation, *has* has three. This necessitates regression modeling which can handle non-binary response variables; I use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo modeling. Through this modeling, I (1) uncover a number of novel predictors shaping contraction of *is*, and (2) demonstrate that many of the patterns shown by *is* are also in evidence for *has*. I also (3) argue that modeling *has*-variation as the product of two stages of binary choices — a common treatment of three-way variation in variationist sociolinguistics — cannot adequately explain the quantitative patterns, which are only compatible with a grammatical model under which three distinct forms vary with each other. The findings have theoretical and methodological consequences for sociolinguistic work on ternary variables.'
