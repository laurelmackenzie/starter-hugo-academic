abstract: 'Bill Labov passed away peacefully at home on December 17, 2024, with his wife and fellow Penn linguist Gillian Sankoff by his
side. He leaves behind a legacy so large that it is hard to put into words. All three authors were fortunate enough to have had Bill
as our PhD supervisor (Laurel: 2012, Meredith: 2014, Betsy: 2018).We feel that the many hours we spent in his presence and with
his work have given us a good insight into who and how he was. We also feel deep love and gratitude for him and for his imprint
on the field and on us. As such, this piece is our reflection on Bill as a person, an advisor, and a scholar, from our perspective as
three of his students from his later years.'
