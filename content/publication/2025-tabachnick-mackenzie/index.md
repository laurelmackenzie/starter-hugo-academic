abstract: 'Traditionally, verbs like *base* have combined with the preposition *on* to express a meaning of derivation (*based on*). However, many writing in a US context have noticed the rapid rise of *based off (of)* alongside *based on* (Curzan 2013; Behrens 2014; Janda 2021). In this article, we document the relative increase of *off* in two English-language corpora in the verb *base* and six other verbs. The results show a clear real-time trend of increasing use of *off*, with some differences in the course of the change across different verbs. We also see an increase in use of *off* in apparent time, which we infer from the topical organization of comments in one of our corpora, the social media site Reddit.'
