abstract: 'This paper probes the well-documented morphological effect on coronal stop deletion
(CSD, also called /t,d/-deletion), by which there is more deletion in monomorphemes
like *mist* than in regular past tense forms like *missed*. We observe that there are, in
principle, additional morphological distinctions that could be made within each
category: for instance, the “regular past” category contains perfect and passive
participles; the “monomorpheme” category typically contains compounds and suffixed
forms. We demonstrate that several of these newly introduced distinctions actually have
significant effects on CSD rates in a corpus of Philadelphia English. And we argue that
these new distinctions are worth attending to because they have consequences for two
existing accounts of the basic morphological effect. In each case, we show that the
existing accounts do not straightforwardly capture the additional significant distinctions
we identify, calling the explanatory power of those accounts into question.'
