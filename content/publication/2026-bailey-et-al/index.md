abstract: 'This study investigates the effects of geographic mobility and dialect contact on the acquisition of lexical variation, with a focus on the words for *bread roll* in British English: an oft-cited example of the rich dialectal diversity across the United Kingdom. In doing so, the study asks whether some dialectal terms are more susceptible to acquisition than others, and whether acquisition is impacted by length of residence in a given area. Data come from the *Our Dialects* survey of British English, with analysis based on over 2,000 mobile individuals. Geospatial analysis techniques are used to identify isogloss borders for the ten most frequent dialectal variants and to track individuals’ residential histories across these areas, comparing these mobility patterns with their self-reported use of different variants. The results reveal that mobile speakers are more likely to demonstrate intra-speaker variation, reporting use of multiple dialectal forms, and that length of residence does significantly impact acquisition, although this patterns in different ways across the lexical items under study. Age-correlated variation also reveals an increase in the use of the supra-local variant roll among younger speakers, pointing to an ongoing process of dedialectalization and the erosion of more traditional, localized forms.'
