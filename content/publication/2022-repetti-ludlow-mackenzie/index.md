abstract: 'From a young age, children go through a stage of leveling irregular forms. They are also known
to probability-match variable phenomena. However, it is still unclear how children treat phenomena
that are both irregular and variable. Does their tendency to overregularize take over, leading them to
seize on the regular occurrences and produce them at an even higher rate than adults, or do children
probability-match in these cases? In order to study this question, we turn to the variably-voiced plurals
of English nouns that end in a voiceless fricative, like *leaves, houses,* and *paths*. We find that children
seem to probability-match for /s/ and /Î¸/-final stems (e.g. *houses, paths*), but not for /f/-final stems (e.g.
*leaves*). This finding has implications for our understanding of first language acquisition, and how learners acquire words with multiple processing requirements.'
